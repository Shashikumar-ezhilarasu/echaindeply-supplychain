### 2. Renamed Test File
- Renamed `tests/hello-world.test.ts` to `tests/product-traceability1.test.ts`
- Updated all contract function calls to reference `product-traceability1`
- Rewrote tests to match the actual functions available in the product traceability contract:
  - `register-user` for user role management
  - `create-product` for product creation
  - `add-product-event` for tracking events
  - `get-product` for product information
  - `get-product-events` for event history
  - `get-product-traceability` for complete traceability
  - `get-contract-stats` for contract statistics

### 3. Updated Deployment Plans
- **Simnet Plan** (`deployments/default.simnet-plan.yaml`):
  - Changed contract name from `hello-world` to `product-traceability1`
  - Updated contract path to reference the new file
  
- **Testnet Plan** (`deployments/default.testnet-plan.yaml`):
  - Changed contract name from `hello-world` to `product-traceability1`
  - Updated contract path to reference the new file

### 4. Test Results
